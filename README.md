# Machine Learning Project #1: Stroke Prediction

## Folder Structure

### Data
All data used in this project can be found in the `data` folder.

*Files:*
- `train.csv` – training dataset
- `test.csv` – test dataset for final predictions
- `sample_submission.csv` – example submission file for Kaggle
- `submission_<model_name_date_time>.csv` → Kaggle submission generated by the specified model
    - Example: `submission_knn_19990101_063000.csv` or `submission_random_forest_20250101_134027.csv`

### src
Contains all source code for preprocessing, modeling, and utility functions.

*Files:*
- `__init__.py` – makes `src` a Python package
- `eda.py` – exploratory data analysis scripts
- `preprocessing.py` – cleaning, standardization, and feature preparation
- `model.py` – all ML model training functions
- `other_functions.py` – utility functions such as `make_submission`

### main.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook runs the full ML pipeline for the project:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature standardization
3. Training all models (KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Ensembles)
4. Model evaluation using F1-score
5. Generating predictions for `test.csv` and creating a submission CSV

> Notes: The notebook calls functions from `src/eda.py`, `src/preprocessing.py`, `src/model.py`, and `src/other_functions.py`.
